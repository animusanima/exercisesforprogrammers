# README #

All programs in this repository don't need special files or settings. They are all solved with basic Java syntax.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This repository contains exercises from the book "Exercises for Programmers - 57 Challenges to develop your coding skills" by Brian P. Hogan
* The main task is to increase my understanding of the Java language, its features and some common behaviour as a professional developer.
* Furthermore I train different things like TDD, Acceptance tests and other stuff while I solve the exercises from the book.
